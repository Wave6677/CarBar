# CarBar
CarBar is a Free Open-Source (FOSS) Android application that implements an intuitive way to interact with your phone while operating a motor vehicle (where legal.) Works on Android 8 Oreo and above

# Roadmap
* Get a public alpha build running featuring: Text, Map and Music app selection support. Minimize and Close buttons. Ability to remap the 3 App launchers and Icons. Ability to move the bar in one of the 4 edges of the screen
* Auto-launch on bluetooth connect
* (Unsure if possible) Auto-enlarge display font scaling for easier reading
