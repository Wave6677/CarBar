# CarBar
CarBar is a Free Open-Source (FOSS) Android application that implements an intuitive way to interact with your phone while operating a motor vehicle (where legal.) Works on Android 8 Oreo and above

# Current Features
At time of writing, CarBar is only a proof of concept. In it's currently released public form it only supports opening 3 apps (Signal, the discontinued ViMusic, and OSMAnd~) with no options to change which apps can be opened. It only uses the system theme and has no current other themes.
